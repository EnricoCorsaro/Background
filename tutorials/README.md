# Tutorial for the background fitting of the red giant star KIC 12008916 using a three Harvey model

In this tutorial you will find an example of format for data and configuring files for one red giant star observed by the NASAâ€™s Kepler mission.
The background model adopted for the test star comprises three Harvey profiles, two describing the granulation activity and one related to long-trend variations (at low frequency).
The figure below provides an example of the resulting fit (in red) to this star using the Background code extension of DIAMONDS.

**NOTE**: the adoption of a different background model simply requires that the input file containing the prior parameters is adapted according to the number of free parameters of the new background model. A list of implemented background models is readable inside the `source/Background.cpp` file, while their actual implementation can ben retrieved from the corresponding .cpp files in the `source/` folder of this extension code.

To run the tutorial follow the procedure:

1. Move the file `KIC012008916/localPath.txt` into `Background/build/`
2. Edit the path inside `localPath.txt` to match your local working path
3. Move the file `KIC012008916/KIC012008916.txt` into `Background/data/`
4. Create an empty directory labeled `00` inside `KIC012008916/`
5. Move the folder `KIC012008916` (and all its content) under `Background/results/`
6. Go to `Background/build/`
7. Execute the code for this tutorial by using the command line 
`./background KIC 012008916 00 ThreeHarvey 0`
